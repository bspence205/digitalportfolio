    "bio": "Hi there! My name is Brian Spencer! I've been coding for over a year and specialize in using React JS and Next JS for developing experiences. As a React developer I've worked on both website clones using the React stack, and vanilla JS projects to build & scale them to completion. Along my journey I realized my passion existed in creating digital experiences for others. With this passion, I have now trained myself to develop real world usable code by reading documentation, getting coaching sessions through my mentor and by progressing through coding bootcamps.",
