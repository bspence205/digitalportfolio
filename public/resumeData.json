    "bio": "Hi there! My name is Brian Spencer! I discovered my love for programming during the COVID-19 lock down and have committed myself to learning the Javascript tech stack. I specialize in using front end technologies for developing responsive web designs and user experiences. As a Front End Developer, I've worked on both website clones using the Javascript stack like ReactJS and NextJS, as well as vanilla Javascript projects to build & scale them to completion. Along my journey I realized my passion existed in creating digital experiences for others. With this passion, I have dedicated myself to develop real world usable code by reading documentation, getting coaching sessions through my mentor and by progressing through personal projects.",
